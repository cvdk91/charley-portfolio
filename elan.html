            <p> Most people will agree that movement is important for our health. But focussing too much on the way that our bodies look might be counter productive, leading to pressure and debilitating insecurities.
                Elan attempts to make an active lifestyle more light-hearted and fun by: </p>
            <p>1. Offering a diverse set of modern courses for all levels and interests</p>
            <p>2. Emphasizing the role of physical activities in building culture and identity.</p>
            <p>3. Communicating that all bodies are awesome.</p>

            <h2> 
                Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>The goal was to develop a fitness app from scratch. Through the brief I could distinguish a target audience: young, urban professionals that often have sedentary jobs. They are open-minded, value different types of art and culture and they might have young children.</p>
            <p>I started off with doing a competitive analysis. One of the main conclusion that came out of the research was that the same type of imagery was used: a svelt body detached of context. It left me questioning whether users felt unrepresented and pressured.</p>

                Setting the stage
            </h2>
            <p>Once the target demographic was defined and the hurdles they face were more defined, it was time to start sketching. The main goals of the ap became:</p>
            <p>1. Making staying active more fun and less inconvenient</p>
            <p>2. Promoting inclusivity and social acceptance.</p>
            <p>I used an iterative approach during the wireframing process. Starting off with pen and paper, I consider the larger structure of the app and the basic elements it needs to function.</p>

            <h2> 
                Choosing a visual identity
            </h2>
            <p>Once the basic information architecture was created, I started to consider the visual design. There were several things that the visual design needed to offer:</p>
            <p>1. It should appeal to a young demographic</p>
            <p>2. It should differ substantially from existing fitness content that focus on weight and
                appearance.</p>
            <p>Since I wanted Elan to communicate inclusivity and an appreciation of activities as part of culture, I decided to look for inspiration from similar industries that appeal to the same demographic: music, film and fashion.</p>
            <p>I tried out two different stylings on the existing screens.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> 
                The outcome
            </h2>
            <p>In the end hight fidelity wireframes and a prototype were created. Besides a physical product, I have also learnt several key values:</p>
            <p>1. Appreciating fun</p>
            <p>While creating products it can be easy to get distracted by established preconceptions on societal needs. “We need to lose weight! We need to be more healthy!” Despite having access to fitness tools, many people still struggle to reach these goals. This project confirmed to me that seeing the importance of enjoyment is critical when creating value for users.</p>
            <p>2. Aligning with your users' identity</p>
            <p>Culture is hard to describe but easy to spot. People allign themselves with visual identities, especially younger (online) generations. That means that a cookie-cutter exterior won’t be able to attract everyone. For this project it was important to target the users that feel currently excluded. Aligning the visual cues with ones that the target demographic recognizes created an app that would easily stand out in a comparison with competitors.</p>
