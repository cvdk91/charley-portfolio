                THE CHALLENGE
            </h2>
            <p>Wrecktify was created for my UX Certification. It is a passion project inspired by life in a country that has more bicycles then people. Unfortunately, taking your bike to a repair shop became more difficult during corona lockdowns. My solution? Bringing cyclists and repair experts together online. </p>
            <p>My goals were to:</p>
            <p>1. Observe the market</p>
            <p>2. Understand the needs of potential users</p>
            <p>3. Propose a solution</p>
            <p>4. Refine the product</p>
            <p>5. Add some (visual) pazazz</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> 
                GOAL 1: OBSERVING THE MARKET
            </h2>
            <p>Through newspaper articles, statistics and qualitative interviews I discovered the following:</p>
            <li>There are more cyclists then ever</li>
            <li>They are becoming more environmentally conscious</li>
            <li>They want to stay active</li>
            <li>They are willing to work hard (cycling through wind and rain) to reach their (moral and physical) goals</li>

            <p>To better understand the current market, I performed a competitive and S.W.O.T. analyses. They provided the following insights:</p>
            <li>There are several websites offering free step-by-step bike repair tutorials</li>
            <li>These target hobbyists or sports-enthused cyclists</li>
            <li>Content is aimed at people with advanced to expert knowledge</li>

            <p>The research showed there was an underserved demographic: the commuter. </p>

            <h2> 
                GOAL 2: UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS
            </h2>
            <p>Next up were user surveys and interviews. I wanted to better understand the frustrating situations potential users might encounter. The most important discoveries were: </p>
            <li>Cyclists would be willing to repair bikes themselves, depending on the effort needed</li>
            <li>Bike owners enjoy that cycling saves them money, keeps them fit, and allows them to go wherever they want</li>
            <li>When it comes to repairs, they mainly feel held back by lack of knowledge, tools, motivation and time</li>
            <li>They are especially wary of being ripped off by bike repair shops</li>
            
            <p>Based on this information, I developed 3 user personas to represent the target demographic.</p>

            <h2> 
                GOAL 3: PROPOSING A SOLUTION
            </h2>
            <p>After gaining a better understanding of the target demographic, it was time to apply this knowledge. I initially started with a Sitemap to create an overview of potential pages. A card sorting study and a similarity matrix helped me sort these pages into 4 distinct categories.</p>

            <p>Then it was time to start sketching. Starting with the most important features: finding a tutorial, finding a mentor and a mentor profile. For speed and flexibility I started off with low-fidelity wireframes.</p>

                GOAL 4: REFINEMENT
            </h2>
            <p>When several screens were developed, I performed  usability tests. A rainbow spreadsheet served as a guideline for further developemnt. After some tweaking I continued with the high-fidelity wireframes in Figma. </p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2> 
                GOAL 5: ADDING SOME (VISUAL) PAZAZZ
            </h2>
            <p>Now that I had a much clearer image of what was expected from the content and flow of the app, it was time to add some personality. Since the app's focus is a Dutch staple (bicyles), I decided to rework an art style that was very distinct for the region: de Stijl. The distinct elements that I used (such as shapes and colours) were reworked for a digital environment. A design language system was used to ensure consistency across platforms.</p>
